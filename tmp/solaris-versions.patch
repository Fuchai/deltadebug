+The next version will be SunOS 5.11, but as of 2006-08-14 it is not
+known whether it will also be called "Solaris 11".
 
 The common terminology is to use the name "SunOS ..." to designate SunOS 2.x,
 3.x, 4.x, and "Solaris ..." to designate SunOS 5.x.
+
+Most of these operating systems are obsolete.  As of 2006-07-24 only
+SunOS 5.7 and later are supported by Sun and are therefore of
+practical porting concern for GNU applications.  For the current list, see
