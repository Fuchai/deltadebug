 /* Compile a Java source file to bytecode.
    java_sources is an array of source file names.
    classpaths is a list of pathnames to be prepended to the CLASSPATH.

+   source_version can be:    support for
+             1.3             inner classes
+             1.4             assert keyword
+             1.5             generic classes and methods
+             1.6             (not yet supported)
+   target_version can be:  classfile version:
+             1.1                 45.3
+             1.2                 46.0
+             1.3                 47.0
+             1.4                 48.0
+             1.5                 49.0
+             1.6                 50.0
+   target_version can also be given as NULL. In this case, the required 
+   target_version is determined from the found JVM (see javaversion.h).
+   Specifying target_version is useful when building a library (.jar) that is
+   useful outside the given package. Passing target_version = NULL is useful
+   when building an application.
+   It is unreasonable to ask for:
+     - target_version < 1.4 with source_version >= 1.4, or
+     - target_version < 1.5 with source_version >= 1.5, or
+     - target_version < 1.6 with source_version >= 1.6,
+   because even Sun's javac doesn't support these combinations.
+   It is redundant to ask for a target_version > source_version, since the
+   smaller target_version = source_version will also always work and newer JVMs
+   support the older target_versions too. Except for the case
+   target_version = 1.4, source_version = 1.3, which allows gcj versions 3.0
+   to 3.2 to be used.
+
    directory is the target directory. The .class file for class X.Y.Z is
    written at directory/X/Y/Z.class. If directory is NULL, the .class
    file is written in the source's directory.
