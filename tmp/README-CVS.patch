  Change your working directory to the findutils source directory (that 
  is, the directory containing this file).   Then run the following 
  command:-

+ This command will use CVS to check out the version of gnulib which is
+ intended to work with the findutils source you already have, as
+ configured by the file import-gnulib.config.  The gnulib code itself
+ is left in the directory "gnulib-cvs".  The "gnulib" directory
+ contains just the gnulib files that findutils needs during the build
+ process.
+
+ If you want to build findutils with a different version of gnulib,
+ just edit import-gnulib.config to change the version and then re-run
+ import-gnulib.sh.  When specifying the version, you can specify
+ either the date or a CVS tag.  If making any kind of release, please
+ use a fully identifying version (rather than just, say, "HEAD").
+
+ The import-gnulib.sh script will also run Autoconf and Automake to
+ generate the "configure" script and "Makefile.in" files.  Should you 
+ need to do this manually, you can do it like this :-
