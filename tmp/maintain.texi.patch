+When you copy legally significant code from another free software

+If you are copying from another FSF-copyrighted package, then we

+that is the case, we don't have papers for it, so you should not copy
+it.  It can't hurt in any case to double-check with the developer of
+that package.
+
+When you are copying code for which we do not already have papers, you
+need to get papers for it.  It may be difficult to get the papers if
+the code was not written as a contribution to your package, but that
+doesn't mean it is ok to do without them.  If you cannot get papers
+for the code, you can only use it as an external library

+@subsection FTP Upload Directive File - v1.1
+
+The directive file name must end in @file{directive.asc}.
+
+When part of a triplet, the directive file must always contain the
+directives @code{version}, @code{directory} and @code{filename}, as
+described. In addition, a 'comment' directive is allowed.
+
+The @code{version} directive must always have the value @samp{1.1}.
+
+The @code{directory} directive specifies the final destination
+directory where the uploaded file and its @file{.sig} companion are to
+be placed.
+
+The @code{filename} directive must contain the name of the file to be
+distributed (item@tie{}(1) above).
+
+For example, as part of an uploaded triplet, a
+@file{foo.tar.gz.directive.asc} file might contain these lines (before
+being gpg clearsigned):
+
+@example
+version: 1.1
+directory: bar/v1
+filename: foo.tar.gz
+comment: hello world!
+@end example
+
+This directory line indicates that @file{foo.tar.gz} and
+@file{foo.tar.gz.sig} are part of package @code{bar}.  If you uploaded
+this triplet to @file{/incoming/ftp} and the system positively
+authenticates the signatures, the files @file{foo.tar.gz} and
+@file{foo.tar.gz.sig} will be placed in the directory
+@file{gnu/bar/v1} of the @code{ftp.gnu.org} site.
+
+The directive file can be used to create currently non-existent
+directory trees, as long as they are under the package directory for
+your package (in the example above, that is @code{bar}).
+
+If you upload a file that already exists in the FTP directory, the
+original will simply be archived and replaced with the new upload.
+
+@subheading Standalone directives
+
+When uploaded by itself, the directive file must contain one or more
+of the directives @code{symlink}, @code{rmsymlink} or @code{archive},
+in addition to the obligatory @code{directory} and @code{version}
+directives.  A @code{filename} directive is not allowed, and a
+@code{comment} directive is optional.
+
+If you use more than one directive, the directives are executed in the
+sequence they are specified in.
+
+Here are a few examples.  The first removes a symlink:
+
+@example
+version: 1.1
+directory: bar/v1
+rmsymlink: foo-latest.tgz
+comment: remove a symlink
+@end example
+
+@noindent
+Archive an old file, taking it offline:
+
+@example
+version: 1.1
+directory: bar/v1
+archive: foo-1.1.tar.gz

+Create a new symlink:
