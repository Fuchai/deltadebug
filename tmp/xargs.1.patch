+Input items are terminated by the specified character.  Quotes and
+backslash are not special; every character in the input is taken
+literally.  Disables the end-of-file string, which is treated like any
+other argument.  This can be used when the input consists of simply
+newline-separated items, although it is almost always better to design
+your program to use `\-\-null' where this is possible.  The specified
+delimiter may be a single character, a C-style character escape such
+as 
+.BR \en ,

+escape codes are understood as for the
